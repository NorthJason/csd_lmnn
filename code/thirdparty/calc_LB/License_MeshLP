DESCRIPTION
	MeshLP software takes a triangle mesh as input, and computes the mesh
	Laplace operator which approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the
	surface approximated by the triangle mesh. 
	
	The source code as well as the binary code is distributed for Linux. 
	The source code is ready to be compiled on other platform though it
	is not tested.
